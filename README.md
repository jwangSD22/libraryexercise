what did I learn?

-Using object arrays is a great way to store information without losing the power to change the
information within as well. 

-You have to use a loop to find the information generated from radio buttons

-prototypes are a great way of accessing a function without generating that function on each individual object

-x- must look into prototypal inheritance. Not sure if generating prototypes in the correct way.

-gained more experience in navigating the dom structure

-gained more experience using "this".

 I believe using "this" has a big relation towards using prototype inherited functions

-fun second experience using a recursive function to remove children from a parent node.(( while a child exists, keep removing the child))

**is there a better way to adjust this list without having to delete the whole list and repopulating it every single time something is changed within the object array? Can this be done dynamically?? maybe it's something another tool needs to manage.

**need to fix CSS to make this prettier

**need to add code to consider that the index# generator could potentially generate a duplicate number, which would result in errors. It should checked if the index# already exists as a property in the array.
